# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization using Tableau

## Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data from 195 countries using Tableau to derive insights on key pandemic metrics such as new cases, deaths, testing rates, positivity rates, and vaccination progress. The analysis provides interactive visualizations to assist governments, health organizations, and stakeholders in understanding pandemic trends and making data-driven decisions.

## Key Features
- **Data Source**: COVID-19 data from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv)
- **Visualizations**: 
  - **Daily New Cases and Deaths**: Interactive line charts with country filters.
  - **Vaccination Progress**: Bar charts tracking vaccination rates by region and date.
  - **Testing and Positivity Trends**: Dual-axis charts highlighting testing rates and positivity rates.
  - **Vaccine Distribution Map**: Geographical visualization of global vaccine distribution.
  
## Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **CSV Data Files**: Dataset imported and connected as a live data source in Tableau.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. **Download Tableau**: If you haven't already, download Tableau Desktop from [here](https://www.tableau.com/).
2. **Download the Dataset**: The COVID-19 dataset can be accessed from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv).
3. **Load the Dataset into Tableau**: Import the CSV file into Tableau Desktop to create live connections for analysis.
4. **Create Visualizations**: Follow the project guidelines to build dashboards, charts, and maps as described in the visualizations section.
5. **Save and Share**: Once visualizations are created, save your Tableau workbook (.twbx file).

## Visualizations Included
1. **Daily New Cases and Deaths**: A time-based line chart that allows users to filter by country and view daily trends.
2. **Vaccination Progress**: A bar chart showing the vaccination rate by country, with the ability to filter by date and region.
3. **Testing and Positivity Rates**: Dual-axis chart displaying both testing rates and positivity rates, enabling region-specific insights.
4. **Vaccine Distribution Map**: An interactive map using color-coding to show the number of vaccine doses administered across countries.

## Insights and Findings
- **Pandemic Progression**: Identified key trends in daily new cases and deaths for countries like the USA, France, and across Asia.
- **Vaccination Trends**: Visualized vaccination progress across Africa, Canada, and the UK, highlighting regions with high and low vaccination rates from September 2021 to August 2022.
- **Testing & Positivity Rates**: Highlighted periods of increased testing in Thailand and significant spikes in positivity rates in Bangladesh.
- **Government Recommendations**: Provided actionable insights for policymakers to manage pandemic responses and optimize vaccination efforts.
